= Introduction
Our application's goal is to allow users to store and share their videos/media.
This service would provide groups of friends and families with a centralized platform to store and manage their media collections.

- Who is your target user/demographic?
  - Friends and Family looking to share personal media files in a more private space
- What value does your application bring the user?
  - A centralized, private, and intuitive platform to manage and share media collections, free from the constraints of overly commercialized alternatives.


== Motivation
In a world that is increasingly more online the average user is forced to use more and more different applications, creating inconvenience and annoyance in what should instead be an easy and efficient service. 
With our product we will bridge this gap, building a platform where the user will be able to consolidate all their media in a secure, personalized, and streamlined way.

While our competitors may include YouTube, Google Drive, and other media sharing platforms, our application seeks to overcome the "commercial" downsides of these other platforms. 
On other available services the user is greatly limited the user's control over the media they are able to upload and store, but with our product the user will be able to keep all their media in one secure home location. 
Unlike our competitors we will put the user first, creating a free, open-source, and less commercialized alternative to other media storage applications.
